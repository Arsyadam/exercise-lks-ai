Pre-processing
- Converting/transforming the dtypes (if necessary)
- Handling Inconsistencies (missing values, duplicates, outliers) by removing/imputation
- Feature addition (if necessary)
- Feature transformation (if the data is biased)
- Feature scaling
- Feature selection
- PCA
- Train test split
- Visualization after handling

Modelling
- Kmeans Class: init, _assign_labels, _update_centroids, fit, _inertia, _silhouette
- Elbow method for inertia and _silhouette

Evaluation Model:
- Clusters distribution
- Cluster characteristic
- Different scenarios output (PCA and non-pca, scaled and non-scaled, etc..)


ðŸ“Š **Inteprete the result**
- All data type was correct with float and 1 integer 
- There are 12 Columns and 4898 row of data
- quality as predicted colummn

Since out target is quality, lets focus on using this column for our Visualization
- Knowing the distribution of targets
- Each quality characteristic in term of fixed_acidity, volatile_acidity and etc.
- does fixed_acidity and volatile_acidity has correlation?
- does free_sulfur_dioxide and total_sulfur_dioxide has correlation?
- Some people have their own preferences in alcohol, like the sweetness level, the thicknes/densitiy level, or even the alcohol content
- What are the factors that makes the sweetness/thickness/alcohol high/low, 

- The highest quality tend to `have less` residual sugar, chlorides, free_sulfur_dioxide, total_sulfur_dioxide but `more` critic, fixed_acidity
- The lowest quality tend to `have more` residual sugar, chlorides, free_sulfur_dioxide, total_sulfur_dioxide but `less` critic
- Interestingly, in some columns, there's always fluctuations in quality `4`


Conclusion Boxplot for each labels
- It is quite hard to discriminate each of the labels because;
- most of them are overlapped
- Their ranges are similiar
- Most of the lower quality has variation in range
- But, higher quality has more consistent characteristic because of smaller range


Conclusion Pairplot
- It is hard to seperate each classes based on numerical columns pairings
- But Alcohol row is kind of unique.
- You can see lighter color is on the upper bound
- While darker color is in the lower bound
- Higher quality has more alcohol
- Lower quality has lower alcohol
