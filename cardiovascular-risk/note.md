1. **Univariate Analysis**
   - General Analysis (dimension, information)
   - Inconsistencies Analysis (missing value, duplication, outliers)
   - Distribution Analysis (Descritive & Diagnostic)
2. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Big picture of all dataset
   - Find the same pattern
3. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Pairplot for numerical
   - faced grid for categorical to numerical
4. **Hypothetical Analysis**
   - Based on dataset
5. **Conclusion & Insight**
6. **Plan for Pre-Processing**

### <div style="background-color:red; padding:20px 30px 20px 30px; border-radius:5px">Pre-processing</div>

1. Handling Inconsistencies
2. Handling Outliers with z-score capping
4. Feature scaling
3. Feature Encoding (If neceserry)
5. Feature selection
7. Train and Test Split
8. Conclusion pre pro and eda linearity

### <div style="background-color:red; padding:20px 30px 20px 30px; border-radius:5px">Modelling</div>

1. KNN brute force based on frequency & weighted (opsional)

### <div style="background-color:red; padding:20px 30px 20px 30px; border-radius:5px">Model Evaluation</div>
## Evaluation Model

A. hyperparameter tuning
1) test size 
2) k 
3) distance
4) leaf size (optional)
5) frequency or weighted

B. Confusion Metrics
explain each of TP, TN, FP, FN

C. Classification Report
Explain what it is Precision, Recall, F1 Score

D. ROC AUC
Explain what it is 

E. Evaluate Model
See the result Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall/Precisions, ROC AUC, Run Time and comparing of each scenario 

F. Proposed best solution
Explain strength and weakness

G. Predict new instance of best proposed (Opsional)


## Hypothetical Analysis 

Hypotheses 1: older people tend to have higher education 
Reasoning: this is in order to validate if higher value in education means higher education

Hypotheses 2: Older People With High Cholesterol and Have a diabetes tend to Have Higher BMI (acceptence 70%)
Reasoning: Older people may tend less exercises because their body have become weaker, and they are sometimes stuborn and don't care about what they eat, this lead them to have high cholesterol or even diabetes, because fat and glucose may cause higher weight 

Hypotheses 3: Older Male People tend to Smoke More (acceptence 70%)
Reasoning: older people tend to have more responsibility, while Male tend to be chief house (they could have many children, means responsibilty), this would cause them to STREE and CIGERATE is like medicine for their stress 

Hypotheses 4: People with High heart rate tend to have high diastolic blood which mean they tend to have Hypertension Status status 
(70%)
Reasoning: High heart rate means they pump blood more, this mean they have high diastolic blood, this could mean they have a hypertension status in which they are always in TENSION

WHY DOES SKEWED data considered as skewed when the std is higher than 3 or below -3
